1) Include the JS and CSS files in a HTML file.
2) Then make an array
3) Inside the array add the path for an audio file (haven't added multi-track compatibility yet)
4) Then simply add the line - createAudioPlayer("anyNameForTheAudioPlayer",yourArrayName);
5) And load the page.

----------------

I know that a lot of it is achievable using HTML 5, but I wanted to make this without too much help from HTML 5.
